# One control plane node and three "workers".
#
# While these will not add more real compute capacity and
# have limited isolation, this can be useful for testing
# rolling updates etc.
#
# The API-server and other control plane components will be
# on the control-plane node.
#
# You probably don't need this unless you are testing Kubernetes itself.
